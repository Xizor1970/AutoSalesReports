﻿﻿AustoSalesReport================ADSR Technologies was founded by [HendrikDreyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hendrik-dreyer-84532322/) and [JonHeap](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-heap-a61500a6/). The company’s existencewas brought about by the creation of its main product, AustoSalesReports (ASR).![](media/d73a07cfa2068c1a9717b65b1d52dd2a.png)The idea behind ASR was to create an amalgamated CRM/Sales Reporting system withpowerful business intelligence capabilities. ASR focusses solemnly on theAustralian automotive industry. ASR has the capability to establish, manage,monitor and measure sales lines across the entire dealership (new, used, fleet,wholesale, finance, insurance and aftermarket). ASR enables managers to closelymonitor the performance of their sales teams. Sales consultants can easily buildand maintain their individual sales pipelines and comfortably track potentialcustomers through various “Road-to-a-sale” built-in steps in ASR. ASR enablesdealer principles to have a birds’ eye view of the entire dealership.ASR also enables each dealership to set individual KPIs for each department,sales manager and sales consultant. This way, at any given time, ASR can swiftly reportand visually portray the current position of the dealerships’ sales targets andhow it is tracking. Ultimately, ASR was built to help dealerships become more profitable, and it does so by assisting them to maximize sales and optimising internal processes such as marketing, service delivery and sales performance.  Figure - ASR Concept![](media/11ddd56ef9f86354a97050a4c817adc5.png)ASR was designed and developed in the Caspio integrated development environment,which is fully functional in the cloud and runs on AWS. Therefore, ASR scalesseamlessly and is deployable at any site that houses an internet connection.Figure - ASR Database Design (MS-SQL-Server)![](media/03910ef078d0ecd1f6109e9ea2ba98c2.png)The functionality behind ASR caters for easy deployment and setup. Noinstallations has to be performed in order to get ASR operational. Once a clienthas signed up for ASR, a dealership account was created and the dealership would beimmediately able to go live.![](media/e06c4e53ae696f3bc5507113453203ac.png)ASR facilitates multiple views into the operations of a dealership. Differentuser levels present different views of operational dealership data.

ASR assistsdealerships in tracking vehicle enquiries, which they in turn must report backto the manufacturers. Manufacturers rely heavily on these enquiry numbers toeffectively plan their production output.Figure - ASR Vehicle Enquiries![](media/72e954d3bca8366d50069c189960d489.png)Sales consultants can easily view monthly sales details by ways of ASR saleslogs.

ASR’s unique architecture allows it to scale seamlessly andeffectively. User administration is hassle-free and user accounts can beactivated and de-activated with ease.ASR also supports email notifications. In the event of a change on a criticalfield in a sales record, sales consultants can automatically notify theirmanagers (and vice-a-versa). This information flow facilitates awareness oninformation changes, which drives customer service and salesefficiency.
